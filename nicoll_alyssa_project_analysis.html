		<h1>Site Intent</h1>
		
		<p>The intent for this project is a complete redesign of Orlando Chinchilla Rescue website. My goals for this job will be to completely restructure the site with proper validating html and css. I am going to recreate the navigation and give the entire site a much needed redesign.</p>
		
		<h1>Targeted Audience</h1>
		
		<p>Our targeted audience is mainly residential which consists of women and couples 30 and younger. These women are usually single and going to college. They have busy hectic schedules and are under a lot of stress. A great way to release stress is to hang out with a pet that is cute and fury. They donâ€™t make very much money, since on average they are students.</p>
		
		<h1>Competitive Analysis</h1>
		
		<p>There are very few other places people can go to get a Chinchilla in the Orlando area and since the Rescues main focus is getting Chinchillas good homes they support other breeders in the area. These are the only other sites that I could find that locally offer a place to get a chinchilla:
			<ul>
				<li>www.centralfloridachinchillas.com/</li>
				<li>www.centralfloridachinchillas.com/ChinsforSale.html</li>
				<li>pets.oodle.com</li>
			</ul>
