			<h3>About</h3>
			<p>Nine years ago I received my first chinchilla. At that time I did not have any information regarding the proper care of chinchillas and the information that her previous owner had given me was incorrect. I began working with a veterinarian who taught me the basic care of chinchillas. From there I began my own research and discovered how little people knew of these wonderful pets.  I am a chinchilla owner located in the Orlando , Florida area.  Most of my work consists of taking in and caring for rescues as well as my own pets. I wanted to start this site to help people become more aware of the proper care of chinchillas and also to share my experiences.</p>
