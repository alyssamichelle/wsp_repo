			<h3>Surrender</h3>
			<p>Here at Orlando Chinchilla Rescue, we understand that things change. Circumstances may not allow you to keep your chin. We take in any chinchillas (or small animals) in the central Florida area. Under certain circumstances, we will be willing to drive a distance to pick up a surrender in other parts of Florida. </p>
			<p>We do not  charge anyone to surrender animals, we also do not pay for animals that are going to be surrendered.</p>
	
			<ul class="whisker_li">
			<p>We strive to find the best possible homes for all of our chins. If you need to rehome your chinchilla please email me with the following information:</p>
			<li>Age, sex and date of birth of chinchilla (or small animal)</li>
			<li>Vet records if any</li>
			<li>Pet store or Breeder?</li>
			<li>Health Problems?</li>
			<li>Female/Male pair? How long together? Any kits(babies) as a result?</li>
			</ul>
 
			<p>When turning over a chinchilla (or other small animal), all supplies (food,hay , dust , toys etc) and the cage are needed. This is to ensure that the chin can go from one enviroment to another with as little stress as possible.</p>

			<h3>Chinchilla Facts</h3>
			<ul class="whisker_li">
				<li>Chinchillas have a life span of up to 20 years. That is longer than most dog breeds!</li>
				<li>Chinchillas take a dust bath, not a water bath. Chinchilla fur can get a "greasy" look if not given a dust bath on a regular basis and is not healthy for the chin.</li>
				<li>Even though this bathhouse is cute, if you are going to have one please be responsible with it. Please do not leave it in a cage or unattended during use. These ceramic bathhouses can be turned over easily and if a chinchilla is inside of it that can be fatal. The baths are too heavy for the chin to lift off of them and they can get stuck inside and suffocate. I use mine for playtime to give the chins a place to cool off while running around after playing. I do not leave them in the bathhouse unattended at any time.</li>
				<li>Chinchilla teeth never stop growing. They need  wooden toys / shelves or pumice stones to help wear them down.</li>
				<li>Chinchillas cannot get hot, they need to be kept indoors with a temperature no higher than 75 degrees.  Imagine going outside in 85 degree weather in a fur coat!</li>
				<li>Chinchillas should be kept indoors. They are not suitable for living outside (actually no animal is) and need A/C in the summer.</li>
				<li>Chinchillas need playtime. What is playtime? Time outside of their cage to jump , run and just get crazy in a chew safe enviroment. No cords, open windows, un-safe situations for them to get into. What they don't need is a giant plastic ball, those work better for gerbils and hamsters, not chinchillas.</li>
				<li>Chinchillas love to run on wheels, they are fun to watch. Watch out! Cheap plastic wheels , and metal with wide spacing  are no nos. A good chinchilla wheel has a solid base, so no feet or tails can get caught. Chances are if you purchased a cheap wheel, more than likely it is not chin safe. Check out my links page to web sites that sell chin safe wheels.</li>
				<li>The wheel in this picture is a very bad wheel. It is dangerous because there is a chance that the chinchilla's tiny feet could slip between the bars while running on the wheel and break her feet.</li>
